I installed yfinance to access the yahoo finance API to access real time stock prices of Apple. I used the datetime and timedelta to specify the start date and end date of the stock prices. From this i downloaded the data which had no null values and all the data types were of the right data types. I utilized plotly to plot the time series by using the candlesticks for data visualization,and also see the patterns of the closing trend which showed that the stock value gained over time. I created a streamlit app to see the same and created a date filter to enable a user filter the dates to their need. The time series was further analyzed into 1 month, 6 months and the year to date. Below is the link to the streamlit App.
